## Regression Analysis

As you can see from plotting the regression line against the scatter plot, we see a positive correlation between the average weight of the mice and the volumn of the tumor (statistically significant relationship given our R^2 value). It makes sense logically that as the tumor gets larger it will thus weigh more and contribute to the overall weight of the mice. Though we would need to do additional analysis to determine if the weight of the tumor is causing this relationship.

## Sex Ratio

The ratio of male and female mice is 49% to 51% after removing the one female mouse which had duplicate data. It is likely that the researchers purposefully did this to have equal representation among their populace.

## Final Results ('Capomulin', 'Ramicane', 'Infubinol', 'Ceftamin')

There are **0** outliers in our data set for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

We can see this reflected in our box plot by a lack of points outside of the wiskers.
